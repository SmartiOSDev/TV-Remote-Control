## Privacy Policy

Harshad Jadav built the TV Remote Control app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Harshad Jadav at free cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at TV Remote Control unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy explains how this app (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information. We take your privacy seriously and do not collect any personal data unless explicitly stated below.

**Information We Do Not Collect**
The App does not collect, store, or transmit:
	•	Personal information
	•	Contact information
	•	Location data
	•	Photos or media
	•	Device identifiers
	•	Analytics or usage tracking
	•	Your Wi-Fi network information
	•	IP address of your phone or your Roku device
We do not run any servers; all features work locally on your device only.

**Information Used Only on Your Device**
To function as a remote control, the App communicates directly with your device (e.g., Roku) over your local Wi-Fi network.
The App uses:
	•	Local network scanning to discover devices
	•	Local IP addresses of devices on your network
This information:
	•	Stays only on your iPhone
	•	Is never stored, never sent to us, and never shared with anyone

**Local Network Permission**
The app requires the Local Network permission to discover and connect to devices on your Wi-Fi.
Apple automatically asks for this permission with the message:
“App would like to find and connect to devices on your local network.”
This permission is used solely to allow communication with your smart device for remote-control features.

**No Third-Party SDKs**
The App does not use:
	•	Advertising SDKs
	•	Analytics SDKs
	•	Tracking SDKs
	•	Social media logins
	•	Third-party data collection libraries

**Data Sharing**
We do not share, sell, or transfer any data because the App does not collect any user data.

**Children’s Privacy**
The App is safe for all ages and does not collect any personal information from children or adults.

**Changes to This Policy**
If we change this Privacy Policy, the updated version will be available on the App Store listing and inside the App.
